# AMU-indicators
**Zhengyu Lu, Ece Bulut, Daryl V. Nydam and Renata Ivanek. Standardization and evaluation of indicators for quantifying antimicrobial use on U.S. dairy farms. (Currently in preparation)**

In this study we selected 16 indicators (count-based, mass-based, and dose-based) applicable for quantifying antimicrobial use (AMU) on U.S. dairy farms. The objectives of this study were to standardize and evaluate these existing AMU indicators based on their accuracy, data needs and effort required, privacy concerns, and ability to inform antimicrobial stewardship in order to aid their uptake on U.S. dairy farms.

Here we included Supplementary Material as part of the study:
* Supplementary Table S1. Definitions of original vs standardized terms (in Tables 1 and 2) used in the calculation of antimicrobial use indicators (Table 3)
* Supplementary Table S2. Reasoning regarding scoring of antimicrobial use indicators for data requirement criteria 
* Supplementary Table S3. Reasoning regarding scoring of antimicrobial use indicators for stewardship criteria
