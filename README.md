# AMU-indicators
**Zhengyu Lu, Ece Bulut, Daryl V. Nydam and Renata Ivanek. Standardization and evaluation of indicators for quantifying antimicrobial use on U.S. dairy farms. (Currently in preparation)**

In this study we selected 16 indicators (count-based, mass-based, and dose-based) applicable for quantifying antimicrobial use (AMU) on U.S. dairy farms. The objectives of this study were to standardize and evaluate these existing AMU indicators based on their accuracy, data needs and effort required, privacy concerns, and ability to inform antimicrobial stewardship in order to aid their uptake on U.S. dairy farms.

Here we included Supplementary Material as part of the study:
* A word document ("Supplementary Material") that includes 3 supplementary tables. The tables include the definitions of original and standardized terms, calculations of indicators for a hypothetical dairy farm and reasoning behing the scores of each indicator.
* An excel document ("Supplementary Table S2") that details the calculations for the hypothetical dairy farm provided in the word document.
